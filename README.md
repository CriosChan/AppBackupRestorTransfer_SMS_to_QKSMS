# AppBackupRestoreTransfer_SMS_to_QKSMS
Just a software that converts your SMS.csv backup from [App Backup Restore Transfer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.infolife.appbackup) to the open source software [QKSMS](https://github.com/moezbhatti/qksms).

All you have to do is make a folder containing the script and your backup. You rename your "SMS.csv" to "input.txt" and run the script with the python command script.py
Of course you need to have [python](https://www.python.org/) installed
